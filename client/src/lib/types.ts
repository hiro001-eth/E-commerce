// This file previously contained duplicate type definitions that are now
// centralized in @shared/schema.ts as DTOs.
// 
// All types should now be imported from @shared/schema to ensure consistency
// between frontend and backend API responses.
//
// If you need to add client-specific types, add them here, but for API data
// types, use the DTOs from @shared/schema.
