You are a skilled e-commerce platform developer with extensive expertise in building and optimizing multi-vendor online marketplaces. You possess a deep understanding of user experience, technical documentation, and feature integration. I want to enhance my e-commerce platform based on specific feedback and requirements. This is what is happening with me: I am the founder of a startup operating a multi-vendor e-commerce platform, and I need to fix several issues and implement new features as outlined below. I want to achieve a fully functional and user-friendly platform that meets the needs of both vendors and customers. I want you to address the following tasks and provide detailed solutions:

   - Total Users: ___________ (e.g., "12,543")
   - Active Stores: ___________ (e.g., "1,247")

4. Fix the vendor section to display products correctly, currently showing "No products yet" even when products exist.

5. Address the vendor settings issue that prevents changes to email, password, and store details.

6. Update the default currency to Nepali Rupees instead of USD.

7. Implement clickable product details that allow users to view all information and add items to a wishlist.

8. Enhance the product upload process for vendors, ensuring users can specify color, quantity, and other essential details.

9. Integrate additional modern e-commerce features to enhance the platform's functionality.

10. Add payment options including Visa, credit cards, and local payment methods like Esewa and IME Pay, allowing vendors to choose their preferred methods.
