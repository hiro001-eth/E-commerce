				1. /Shop is showing error of these  shown below :
						[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set
to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.
Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.
You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.
fix these all and make it smooth error free code .
