Execution Guidelines for AI Agents

Accuracy is critical: All dynamic data must reflect the real database.

Security first: No secrets should be exposed anywhere.

Testing required: Every feature must be verified locally before deployment.

Documentation: Update documentation after every change with screenshots/examples.

Code standards: Use TypeScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and follow best practices.
