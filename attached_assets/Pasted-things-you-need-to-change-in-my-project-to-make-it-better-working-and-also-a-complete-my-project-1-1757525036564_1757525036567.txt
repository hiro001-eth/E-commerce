and add when user buy product then user can able to create an review and here in the home section it should show not by default option 


8. remove all this error [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] A <Select. Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.
Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.
You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js. which i cant able to fix it , fix by your self and give it to mee and also a databases should be strong and best to handle all the data flow through webapp . 


bonus point make it full of featurese , teranaction , smooth and also a animation need to increases too .
