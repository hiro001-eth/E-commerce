Based on your requirements, let me check the current status and give you an honest assessment of what's been completed and what still needs work.

Checked system logs

Decided on product upload enhancement (6 seconds)
No, not everything is complete yet. Let me give you an honest status update:

✅ COMPLETED:
Fixed React import errors causing crashes
Removed sensitive technical documentation from /docs
Fixed admin login access (use "Admin Login" button)
Fixed vendor products display issue (API routing conflict resolved)
Homepage stats showing real-time accurate data
Currency converted to Nepali Rupees (NPR)
Product details pages with wishlist functionality
❌ STILL PENDING:
Enhanced product upload (color variants, min/max quantities)
Payment integration (eSewa, IME Pay, Visa, credit cards)
Review/rating system (post-purchase only with images)
Fix product persistence issues after page refresh
Vendor settings functionality (partially working)
Modern e-commerce features (filtering, search, recommendations)
Smooth animations and effects
Let me continue working on the remaining tasks. I'll start with the enhanced product upload functionality since that's a core feature vendors need.
