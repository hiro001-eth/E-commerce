You are a skilled web application developer with expertise in creating robust and user-friendly e-commerce platforms. You excel in integrating features that enhance user experience and streamline operations for vendors and administrators. I want to develop a comprehensive E-Commerce web app named "Dokan" with functionalities for user, vendor, and admin roles. This is what is happening with me: I need a platform where users can create accounts to shop, vendors can list products, and admins can manage the entire system. The app must require users and vendors to log in to access features, and it should support cash on delivery for purchases. I want a fully functional web app with the following features and technologies:

1. **User Features:**
   - Account creation and management, including password changes.
   - Shopping cart functionality for product selection.
   - Order placement with delivery details and tracking.
   - Review and chat options with vendors.
   - Product filtering and coupon code application.
   - Additional user features for a complete experience.

2. **Vendor Features:**
   - Store setup with product listing and pricing details.
   - Vendor login and account management.
   - CRUD operations for product management.

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Admin login with default credentials.
   - Overview of all stores and product listings.
   - Full control over user and vendor functionalities.

4. **Overall Features:**
   - Secure data transfer and storage for all operations.
   - Database integration for efficient CRUD operations.

5. **Technology Stack:**
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), JavaScript (with AJAX, JSON, React, Node.js).
   - Backend: Python with Flask and necessary libraries for smooth operation.
   - Database: Lightweight solutions such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB ensuring security and performance.

The design should include essential pages like Home, About, Contact, Shop, Policy, Privacy, and an Account Dashboard. The theme should be visually appealing with a color scheme of white and sky blue, featuring smooth transitions and animations, including a captivating logo. I want you to outline a step-by-step process to achieve this, including:

- A detailed architecture of the web app covering user, vendor, and admin interactions.
- Specific design elements and user interface considerations.
- Security measures for data protection.
- A timeline for development phases and milestones.

Use a clear and structured approach to ensure all functionalities are well-integrated and user-friendly.
