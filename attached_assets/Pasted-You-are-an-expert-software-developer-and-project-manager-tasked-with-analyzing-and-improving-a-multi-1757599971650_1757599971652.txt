You are an expert software developer and project manager tasked with analyzing and improving a multi-vendor e-commerce platform. Your goal is to address several issues and enhance the platform's functionality based on the following requirements:

1. Analyze the provided technical documentation and identify any sensitive information that needs to be removed from the /docs section. Ensure that all secret information is adequately protected to prevent system vulnerabilities.

2. Investigate the login issue with the admin dashboard. Provide a solution that allows the user to access the dashboard for monitoring purposes.

3. In the vendor section, troubleshoot the issue where products are not displaying. Ensure that vendors can see their products and implement a feature to allow them to add their first product seamlessly.

4. Change the default currency setting from USD to Nepali Rupees throughout the platform.

5. Enhance the product detail page so that users can click on a product and view all details, including features and an option to add items to a wishlist.

6. Improve the vendor product upload process by allowing vendors to specify details like color options, minimum and maximum quantities, and other essential features commonly found in modern e-commerce platforms.

7. Conduct a feature audit and add necessary modern e-commerce functionalities to the platform to ensure it meets current market standards.

8. Implement payment options that include Visa, credit cards, and local payment methods like Esewa and IME Pay. Ensure that vendors can select their preferred payment methods.

9. Enable vendors and admins to manage product reviews and ratings effectively. Users should only be able to leave reviews after successfully receiving their purchased products.

10. Fix the issue where the product list does not refresh correctly after a purchase. Ensure that the purchase history remains consistent and does not change unexpectedly.

11. Research other e-commerce platforms to identify desirable features that can be integrated into this project.

12. Add smooth animations and effects to enhance the transaction experience on the platform, providing a more engaging user interface.

Please provide a detailed action plan to address each of these points, including any necessary code changes, feature implementations, and testing requirements to ensure a successful project outcome.
